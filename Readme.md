# Dispatch System Algorithm
- Initializing with a demo project having a part to receive the job from front end
- Second part having the details of the driver

# Stage 1
- Finding the nearest drivers to pickup location 
- Finding where they are headed to currently.
- Finding the distance between delivery location and where they are headed to
- Using all these factors assigning the job to the driver
- This is a static system using only distance as the parameter

# Stage 2
### Stage 2 would use the parameters more dynamically and use the most important factor of time
